# st2195_assignment_6
Practice assignment number 6 for st2195.

Ultimately, not a vast difference was found in the words, although I am not sure if I did it correctly :).

Interesting notes:
- Union, Integration and Global only appear on the top 20 of bad news.
- Affairs, New and Bank only appear on the top 20 of good news.
- Challenges appears at a higher frequency on bad news, although crisis appears at a lower rate.
